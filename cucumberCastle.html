                    <p>Unreal Engine 5 released in April 2022. Since the beginning of my game development career, I yearned to learn how to create through Unreal Engine. During the summer between my sophomore and junior year of college, with new found free time, and the coincidental release of the new Unreal 5, I began the process to finally learn Unreal!
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I found a Youtube tutorial detailing not only the Unreal Engine, but also the differences the new 5th version brought to the battlefield. It was educational, covering all of the basics of the Engine, along with an extra hour at the end where you built a world with the teacher.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I used the video as a basis for the world I created myself, adding personal details that the video did not provide. I used the new Megascan library to add landmarks to my world such as a garden, crumbling pillars, and a railroad. The tutorial video I watched was a perfect start into the vast engine, and I feel motivated to continue making newer and advanced projects in the Unreal!
                    </p>

                    <h6>Learning Experiences:</h6>
                    <div class="gameInfoDescription">
                        <p>The tutorial video was separated into multiple sections. We began with an overview of the UI, and that lead into movement and post processing. I learned about how to create and use objects and materials, along with textures. We then went over landscapes and foliage.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>After the basics I dove into some deeper topics. The idea of master materials, flexible materials that you can edit mid-creation. The brand new real-time lighting system, Lumen, and how it compares to the previous Unreal 4 of baking in light maps.
                            Along with Nanite, a new rendering algorithm that shifts the amount of polygons per objects to optimize processing power. </p>
        
                        <p>A good portion of the tutorial was dedicated to the coding aspect of the engine. Instead of C++ the tutorial explained how to use Blueprints to code the game. They were very simple, and I was able to use them to create collectables throughout the map that increase your total score!

                    <h6>Conclusion:</h6>
                    <div class="gameInfoDescription">
                    <p>I had always been intimidated by Unreal Engine because it gave off the impression that it was an advanced and powerful piece of software that only experienced developers attempt to use. I am glad to say that after learning it, I realized that was not the case at all.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Unreal Engine, especially the new 5th version, is powerful, but also convenient. There were multiple features that comfortably introduced me to the software. It is a tool that is easy to learn but hard to master, which only motivates me more to learn the deeper mechanics of it.</p>
    
                    <p>Although my strong suit is Unity and C#, this project opened my horizons to many new ideas and possibilities. Some of the most beautiful projects were created in Unreal and one day I will have the knowledge to create a fully functional game in the software.
