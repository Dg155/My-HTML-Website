                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <div class="gameDescription">
                <p>During the 2020 COVID Outbreak I was at a low in my life. I had lost the ability to see my friends and family, I couldn't finish my high school and have a graduation, and I was stuck at home without much to do.
                    In this trying time I looked towards a life long comfort of mine, game development.
                </p>

                <p>In the 10th grade I began a Udemy course that explores many aspects of the game engine Unity, and teaches you to code within C#. I made some progress and followed the provided steps to create small games like text based adventures and Atari breakout, however I never used my skills to create my own original project.
                    I decided to revisit the course and begin once again from new! </p>

                <p>After a few lessons my motivation sky rocketed. One of the projects taught throughout the course was a tower defense game. I took what they taught me as a basis and began adding my own sprites, story, music, game modes, and characters until I completed my first fully functional game!

                    <h3>Learning Experiences:</h3>
                    <div class="gameDescription">
                    <p>This project opened my eyes to the possibilities that the Unity engine can provide. After reviewing basic topics I explored the idea of Player Prefs. This introduced the ability for the player 
                        to have flexible settings based on their choice that will effect the entirety of the game, for example volume or difficulty.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>It was also my first introduction to the idea of inheritance, the powerful tool of having multiple different classes inherit the same code from the base class. This strengthened my coding style and improved
                        game efficiency as I had each of the players and enemies inherit many attributes from their respective base classes.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Other than the coding aspects of the project, I had to account for art and sounds as well. It was the first time I felt like I was truly producing a whole game because I commissioned people to create those aspects of the game
                        where my skills fell short. This experience made me realize how difficult game creation can be, but also how satisfying the pay off is once you've completed your work.

                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                    <div class="gameDescription">
                    <p>It took nearly 3 months to complete this game, although it was only 6 levels. I made sure each feature was polished to a shine and I coded it effectively to the best of my current abilities.
                        It was extremely difficult but once it was complete I had hit a high strong enough to compete with my Covid low.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I sent the game over to many friends and family, and they all loved it. It was a glimpse into the reason why I started game development in the first place, to make others feel good, and it
                        made me all the more motivated to continue down this path. </p>
    
                    <p>In the upcoming years I will be tackling games with large enough scope that they would need an entire team of workers to cover all the bases, however if a situation ever arises again like covid (God forbid)
                        I would love to sit down, and try to create something from scratch all by myself to see how much I've improved since the original outbreak.
