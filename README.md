# My-HTML-Website
Here is my portfolio website I created using HTML/CSS/JS!

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

14/14
- 1/1 Readme
- 3/3 Basic HTML content
- 3/3 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 3/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
  I added a header which included my website name and a navigation bar to go between pages of my website, multiple images with alt text, links near the bottom to
  external pages, and HTML tags throughout the scripts.
  
(b) CSS features
  I created borders and padding around each game entry in my portfolio. I utilized grid layout within each game entry, and a custom font for my game titles from Google fonts.
  I also attempted to make each game entry unique with its color pallete so they all stand out!

(c) Advanced features
  I added slight animations thorughout my entire page. The navigation buttons in the header pop up one at a time every time you load the page, my head shot on the "about"
  page zooms into view, and each of my game entries appear as you scroll down. I also utilized javascript in order to present a slideshow for each of my games, and
  to create modals that will appear each time you click a slideshow image.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
  I have worked at least 20 hours on this website.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
    I have used a few javascript files from the internet:
      1. jQuery https://jquery.com/
      2. Cycle2 for the slideshow https://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/
      3. lightbox2 by Lokesh Dhakar https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/


5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
  Before the assignment I had taken a HTML and CSS course on Udemy which taught me the basics and other features outside of this class. Other than that I did not
  discuss the assignment with outside sources or others.



6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
  When my website is checked by the validators:
    1. W3C is passed
    2. With Wave there were 3 major errors, however those errors are out of my control as they deal with javascript files I have imported. One is missing alt text for 
    an image that is not even viewable on the website, and the other 2 are empty links which again are not visible. The 12 contrast errors are due to minor
    inconveniences such as the small dots near the top of the slideshows or the buttons near the bottom of my page which do have good contrast but are not picked up
    from the validator.
    3. For AChecker, the only known problems deal with my headers, however I am not sure why they appear nor how to fix them. They state that I am using an h2 header 
    where only h3 headers are allowed but once I switch the headers to h3 it results in more errors. I believe I used the headers correctly so I am not sure why this 
    error even appears but it seems to be minor, I hope it is something we can disregard.
