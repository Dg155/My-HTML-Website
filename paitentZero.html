                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Once my sophomore year in college began I was eager to begin working on collaborative game development project. Up until that point I had only worked on game projects by myself, and I knew I needed the experience of working in a group if I wanted to get anywhere in the industry.
                </p>

                <p>Conveniently one of my peers approached my with an opportunity. She was the main producer for a 3D virtual reality education game on Unity. She described to me that it was a game geared towards conveying biological concepts in an entertaining and interactive manner.</p>

                <p>The concept was interesting, and it would be my first time not only working in a group, but developing a VR game. I knew there were many new things I would learn if I applied for the role, so I did. After an interview and some time I was accepted and began to work on the project throughout my entire sophomore year.

                    <h3>Learning Experiences:</h3>
                    <p>The process proved to require determination creativity. Every week we held meetings where I was assigned a task to complete for the week, and in turn report on what I completed the previous week.
                        I started with struggles as I had to jump into the game mid-creation, whereas most of the development team had been working on it for at least a year. I took the time to go through the already implemented features and code.
                        Being forced into this position made me much more flexible as I learned effective ways to recover into the already implemented features, along with adjusting my code to fit a more reflective style to help others easily determined what my own contributions achieved.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>It was not only the social environment that forced me to improve my coding style, but also the aspects of the game itself. It was my first time working in 3D unity, let alone VR. 
                        I immersed myself in VRTK, a unity extension to add VR support to a project, while being assigned weekly tasks like bug fixing and voice line implementation. It honed my multitasking ability while also sharpening my C# knowledge about concepts such as locomotion and data structures.

                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p> Working with a team yielded many benefits, especially time optimization. At first it was difficult to work around and with everybody but after a few weeks we fill into a rhythm where we were producing like clockwork.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I found that these people I was working with were not just business acquaintances, but co-parents that all together nurtured this project until it became its own fully functional game. It was exciting seeing the progress that others made, and being able to contribute to that progress myself.</p>
    
                    <p>These days major games are created by groups or companies. It is difficult to find a popular project that was developed by one or two people. The skills I acquired through this project will skyrocket me through the gaming industry as I will have a strong knowledge of what to expect in a collaborative game development, and I cannot wait to put them to use.
