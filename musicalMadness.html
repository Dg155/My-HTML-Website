                <div class="gameInfoDescription">
                <p>Cue the beginning of 2022. With multiple months of experience working collaboratively with a team to create a video game, it was time for me to take the next step in my game development career.
                </p>

                <p>Video Game Development Club (VDGC) is a club hosted by many schools where game developers come together and discuss the many aspects of gaming, including creating and playing. Luckily University of California,
                    Irvine, my undergraduate school, offered this club and it was about time I began to make my mark within it.</p>

                <p>I attended the first meeting of the school quarter, where the board members described that as a member you could either pitch a game and lead a group of your peers in its creation, or you could join the team of a 
                    project that has been pitched. I naturally went for the leadership role, along with my roommate, and together we created Musical Madness!

                    <h6>Learning Experiences:</h6>
                    <div class="gameInfoDescription">
                    <p>Musical Madness is a top down dungeon shooter focused on the theme of music. Creating the project sharpened my C# knowledge, leadership skills, critical thinking and design choices. Leading the project was a
                        massive hurdle to overcome because there were many moving parts we had to keep track of. Since it was my roommate and I's first leadership role in game development we were not experienced to facilitate an organized
                        and effective system, however throughout each week we grasped the idea stronger than before. I learned how to effectively organize meetings, exchange information between team members, and portray project progress.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>My roommate and I created diagrams and developed the architecture for the scripts and game components before we started coding. This yielded a convenient and flexible design to the game. We planned the entire project
                        centering around the idea of randomly generated rooms strung together to form a maze, unique each time someone plays the game. We took advantage of procedural generation along with discrete mathematics
                        to complete this design concept. We thought about using bit strings to denote the types of rooms we would generate, confirming that the rooms selected by procedural generation would comply with each other.

                    <h6>Conclusion:</h6>
                    <div class="gameInfoDescription">
                    <p>When development first began my ambitious self imagined a huge scope for the game, something that would not be able to be completed with a quarter of schooling, let alone 10 weeks. Although we cut many aspects
                        from the final release, the components we implemented were polished, resulting in a clean and optimized gaming experience!
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I am going to create my own video game company one day, leading my group of peers throughout this project showed me that it is not easy to produce a large scale project, however it also
                        taught me that with practice and experience, I can heartily fulfill that leadership role and produce something spectacular. </p>
    
                    <p>I wish we all had more time together to brainstorm and develop. I hope to pick up this project again in the future and add all the features we never had the time to get to.
